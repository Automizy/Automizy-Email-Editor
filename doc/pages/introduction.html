        <h3>For free? Sounds suspicious!</h3>
        <div class="paragraph">
            Automizy Email Editor is published under the well-known <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License' target='_blank'>MIT license</a>, it isn't our main product, only a part of our marketing automation system called <a href='http://automizy.com/' target='_blank'>Automizy</a>. Since we also use a bunch of free stuff ourselves (jQuery, TinyMCE, etc.), we decided to do something good for mankind, like giving a free product which can contribute to other's successes.

            A simple example:<br><br>
            <pre class='prettyprint linenums'>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html>
&lt;html>
    &lt;head>
        &lt;link href="css/automizy-email-editor.css" />
        &lt;script src="js/automizy-email-editor.js">&lt;/script>
        &lt;script>
            $AEE.init().open();
        &lt;/script>
    &lt;/head>
    &lt;body>&lt;/body>
&lt;/html>
            </pre>
